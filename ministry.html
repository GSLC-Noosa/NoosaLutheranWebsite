								<span style="color:#2F5597; font-size:3em">gather<br><br></span>
								<p> At Good Shepherd we embrace growing together in Christ’s love.  It’s why we encourage God’s people to look for opportunities to fellowship together, to eat together, to pray together, to play together, and to spend time in God’s Word together.

								<p style="margin-bottom:0"><b><span style="color:#00bc00"><br>Bible Studies<br></span></b>
								Bible Study groups are organised in the congregation from time to time, and they meet in private homes or at the church. Small groups meet over a cuppa to read and discuss God's word under the guidance of the pastor or lay leader.  If you are interested in being part of a group joining one, please contact the Church Office (07 5455 8645).
							  </p>
							  <p><b><span style="color:#00bc00"><br>KYB: Know Your Bible<br></span></b>
								KYB uses a question and answer learning method, reinforced by group discussion, summaries and review notes. The CWCI International Board produces a new KYB study for each term. Study books for terms 1,2 and 3 have nine units, and Term 4 has 5 units.   Each unit is made up of daily Bible readings and questions, which are completed during the week before the meeting. Notes for KYB leaders are supplied in a separate Leader’s guide.
							  </p>
								<p><b><span style="color:#00bc00">Grow Groups<br></span></b>
									Grow Group are our small group ministry.  Life is not meant to be lived alone. In fact, God hates loneliness. You were created to experience life with other people, and that’s why at Good Shepherd we encourage you to get into a small group.
									Groups come in all shapes and sizes — married couples, singles, men, women, kids, no kids, workplace, under 20, over 40 — the list goes on. No matter where you are in life, there’s a group for you.
									At Good Shepherd we encourage everyone to be part of a Grow Group. Grow Groups help each other to fulfil our God given purposes of: Be Loved, Belong, Become, Be Blessed. Join a Grow Group today.

								<p><b><span style="color:#00bc00">Pastor's Classes<br></span></b>
								Each year our pastor conducts a course which explains the Christian faith and the Lutheran understanding in particular. The aims are to give a global perspective on the Bible, faith and God, answer some of the big questions people have, and maybe make some new friendships over coffee. For further information contact  the Church Office (07 5455 8645).
								</p>
								<p><b><span style="color:#00bc00">Faith Milestones<br></span></b>
									Several times a year our men meet for a special fellowship. This is generally over a BBQ meal with gourmet foods supplied. A guest speaker presenting an interesting and challenging topic is often part of this gathering. Our members are encouraged to invite their friends and associates to join us in our informal gatherings, to add to the dynamics of meeting other menfolk who are not associated with our congregation. Each Men’s Night is advertised in the Sunday Bulletin. For further information on men's activities please contact Graeme Handreck (5471 0475).

									<b><span style="color:#00bc00">CrossWalk: Intergenerational Ministry<br></span></b>
									<b>CrossWalk</b> is designed to foster intergenerational community by   bringing generations together around four activities based on the early church in Acts 2:42: <i>“They committed themselves to the apostles teaching and to the fellowship, to the breaking of bread, and to prayer”</i>.</p>

								<p></p>

								<ul>
									<li>Interactive Worship that includes all voices</li>
									<li>Fun, faith and formation together</li>
									<li>Story-sharing and wisdom across generations</li>
									<li>Shared meals, celebrations and fellowship</li>
								</ul>
								<i>Connecting faith to life, and parents to kids in a powerful, playful way.</i>
